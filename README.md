## 1. client-server model: 
      Used flask framework to build http server by "pip install flask" command. This server is run on port 8000. Using "app.run(port=8000)" to run the server.    
      Used postman as a client to send HTTP request.  


## 2. End Points
      Terminal end point is http://127.0.0.1:8000 for local host. First end point is static, so to make a dynamic end point, one query parameter is given e.g 
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/findNonRepeating?string=hhgghghssj
         

## 3. Query Parameter 
      Data is passed through parameter. Request reaches the server which uses algorithm of dynamic endpoint to complete the request of client.
